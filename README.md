# Genetic_Algo_Projects

## Genetic Algorithm
* Search-based optimization technique.
* Based on natural selection and genetics.
* Simulate “survival of the fittest”

### Rules:
* **Selection rules** prefers to the individuals with good fitness scores and allow them to pass there genes to the successive generations.
* **Crossover rules** combine two parents to form children for the next generation.
* **Mutation rules** apply random changes to individual parents to form children.

## Projects:
1. Coded a genetic algorithm that generates a sentence similar to original sentence based on fitness function to understand the working and effects of tweaking various parameters.
2. Developed a genetic algorithm that generates different bottle shapes by altering pixel values.
3. Developed a genetic algorithm that generates different bottle shapes by altering the vectors values.
